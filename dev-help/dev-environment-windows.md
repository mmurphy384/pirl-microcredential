# Smart Contract Development on Windows with Visual Studio



## Purpose
The purpose of this guide is to help new-to-Pirl developers set up a development environment using a Windows machine, running Visual Studio.  Let's try to keep this lean-and-mean.  No need to have 100 links.  Let's just have the top 10 resources for devleoping on Windows.



## 1. Using Visual Studio
There's a solidity extention available:

This is pretty cool.  I didn't even know Windows 10 has a built in bash shell.  I'm not even a big ubuntu guy, but this one is appealing.  Much easier than setting up a VPS.  The nice thing about running things in Ubuntu is that there seems to be no shortage of resources.  As I get this figured out, I'll add more tips.
