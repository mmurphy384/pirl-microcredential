# Micro-Credentails Sprints

## Until we get a little more complex, we'll just use this page.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current Sprint
  * Review basic UI/UX needs
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * Pick a tech stack
      * Hand draw the pages on contract instantiantion
  * Review how crypto-averse K12 administrators are going to figure out how to work with a smart contract.
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * Decide if we should just assume the user has Meta Mask to take the easy way out.  Or, we WE should take on the management of the contract.
      * Decide the types of management functions we should add in the contract factory (for example, we can set our fees, kill a contract, etc)
  * Project Review
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * At this point, we should have a feel for what the project is and some of the emerging difficulties.  It might be healthy to have a 'go' or 'no-go' decision.  I'm not married to this idea, so if we want to do something else, this might be the time.
