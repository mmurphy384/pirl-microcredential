# Micro-Credentails Sprints

## Until we get a little more complex, we'll just use this page.

## Current Sprint
  * Learn a bit about solidity
	  * Acceptance Criteria: Get through Crypto-Zombies tutorial
  * Create a development environment that we all like
	  * Acceptance Criteria: Create the /dev-help guide that documents our development environment (coding + test rpc/ganache + folder structure)

    * Acceptance Criteria
      * Mike to create basic use-cases.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Next Sprint
  * Review basic UI/UX needs
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * Pick a tech stack
      * Hand draw the pages?
  * Review how crypto-avers K12 administrators are going to figure out how to work with a smart contract.
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * Decide if we should just assume the user has Meta Mask to take the easy way out.
      * Decide some other way that a regular human will be able to figure this all out.
  * Project Review
    * Acceptance Criteria:
      * At this point, we should have a feel for what the project is and some of the emerging difficulties.  It might be healthy to have a 'go' or 'no-go' decision.  I'm not married to this idea, so if we want to do something else, this might be the time.
